## Statistics

Script `mirrors_stat.py` can collect statistics of using the mirrors service for following url:
* `/mirrorlist/<version>/<repo>`
* `/isos/<arch>/<version>`

The script puts this statistics to Node Exporter stats files or can print it to stdout.

Use help of the script for more information.
